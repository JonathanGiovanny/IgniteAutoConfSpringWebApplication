# IgniteAutoConfSpringWebApplication
Ignite project with Spring boot.

Waiting for 2.7.0 release of apache Ignite to solve issues with spring boot.

**Issues**
- It requires an IgniteCache instance for spring boot otherwise it generates an error that only the new release will solve (or I touch the code, which will not happen soon).
- Don't remember
